# Groupie Tracker Search Bar

## Objectives

This project follows the same principles as the original Groupie Tracker but focuses on implementing an advanced search functionality.

### Groupie Tracker Search Bar consists of:
- **Creating a functional program** that allows users to search through the website's database for specific text inputs related to bands, artists, members, locations, or important dates.
- The goal is to enhance the client’s interaction with the data by providing efficient search capabilities.

### Search cases must include:
- **Artist/band name**
- **Members**
- **Locations**
- **First album date**
- **Creation date**

### Features:
1. **Case-insensitive search**: The search functionality should not be sensitive to capitalization.
2. **Typing suggestions**: As the user types, the search bar should display suggestions matching the input.
3. **Suggestion types**: The search bar must identify the type of suggestion, such as whether it’s an artist, member, or location.
   - For example: If you type "phil", it should suggest "Phil Collins - member" and "Phil Collins - artist/band".

## Requirements
- The **backend** must be written in **Go**.
- The website should remain stable at all times (no crashes or errors).
- The code must follow **best practices** and include **unit tests**.

### Technologies:
- **Go** for the backend.
- **HTML** for the frontend.
- **JSON** for managing the API data.

### Allowed Packages:
- Only the **standard Go packages** are allowed.

## Usage

This project will help you learn:
- **Data manipulation** and search functionality.
- **Client-server communication**.
- How to manage **JSON** data and formats.
- **Web development** with Go and HTML.
